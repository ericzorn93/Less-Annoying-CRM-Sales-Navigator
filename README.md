# Less Annoying CRM Upload from Eva Boot

This CLI tool takes a specifically formatted `csv` file from [EvaBoot](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj50qCLo7CDAxVxhYkEHawUAAcQFnoECAcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevaboot.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw2IGegh_AaYoSDrORMVBXpo&opi=89978449), parses it from the file path, forms a JSON payload and concurrently updates the Less Annoying CRM with these specific contacts.

Without this tool, having to parse data from the EvaBoot exports from LinkedIn Sales Navigator would be difficult and time intensive for individually adding each of these sales prospects to your **database/CRM**.
